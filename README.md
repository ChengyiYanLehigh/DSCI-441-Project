# ML-Project
 
## Summary
This project aims to build a entertainment recommendation system for people. Uses can input their favorite books, movies, games, etc., and the system will suggest other titles that may interested them.\
The system will use many recommendation algorithms like Content-Based Filtering, Wide and Deep, etc., to do the task. The model will receive multiple features from datasets, which include information about the entertainments, and then use machine learning algorithms to uncover potential interests. Also, there will be a feedback mechanism which will allow users to rate suggestions, helping the model to adapt and improve continuously.\
